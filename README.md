# react-canvas-video

this is a fork of react-canvas-video, with modernized syntax and functionality (and more dependencies):
1. A full screen button and facilitated using react-reverse-portal.
2. requestAnimationFrame is used instead of setTimeout.
3. Class based components are migrated to hooks - more succinct handling of effects, including attaching and detaching of event listeners.
4. Styling is moved from light mode to dark mode, and is written using styled-components for each component.
